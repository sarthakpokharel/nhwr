                <ul>
                    <li>To provide detailed information about all health facilities and their location (on a live map).
                    </li>
                    <li>To permit filtering to show different kinds of facilities and the services they provide.</li>
                    <li>To allow users to search for closest or preferred facility by name or type of service required.
                    </li>
                    <li>To give information on shortest distance between one facility and another to
                        enable rational planning for referral.</li>
                    <li>To visualize service coverage by population density at the Palika/Ward level.</li>
                    <li>To help planners identify gaps or clustering of specific types of services.</li>
                    <li>To enable creation of helpful graphs and tables.</li>
                    <li>To be linked with other databases to show licensing information,
                        emergency sites for earthquake or epidemic response, and much more.</li>
